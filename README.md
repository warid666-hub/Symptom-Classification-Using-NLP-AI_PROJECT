## Symptom Classification Using NLP

This project is an AI/NLP-based binary text classification system that classifies medical symptom descriptions into two categories using machine learning.

## 📌 Project Overview
  ## Domain:
       Artificial Intelligence / Natural Language Processing
 ## Task: 
      Binary Text Classification
 ## Labels:
      0 → Class 0
      1 → Class 1
 ## Model Used:
      Logistic Regression
##  Feature Extraction:
          TF-IDF
## Accuracy Achieved: 
         82.5%

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of three parts:
1.Training set
2.Validation set
3.Test set

Each sample contains:
A symptom-related sentence
A binary label (0 or 1)
