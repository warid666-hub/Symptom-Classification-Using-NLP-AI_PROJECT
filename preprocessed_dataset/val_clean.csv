"My husband and I live in an apartment that gets super cold easily. Part of that is because there's no protective trees in the winter, with the other problem being the buildings are run down, and there's lots of cracks around the door.

Our heaters are old baseboard heaters that can heat the home, but run up our electricity bill like crazy.
