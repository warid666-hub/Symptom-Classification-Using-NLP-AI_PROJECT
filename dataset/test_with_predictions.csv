"Even present-day situations where they are receiving love from a safe person can trigger the awareness and subsequent grief of knowing how unloved they were by comparison. Anxiety and depression are considered commonplace, but I suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse.

Many survivors of complex trauma are often misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD) or bipolar disorder.",,Test,even present day situation receive love safe person trigger awareness subsequent grief know unloved comparison anxiety depression consider commonplace suspect many consider anxious depressed actually experience fallout trauma therapist well train handle trauma especially complex kind stem prolong exposure abuse unless specially certify might hour graduate school cluster personality disorder even few hour help survivor many survivor complex trauma often misdiagnose borderline personality disorder bpd bipolar disorder,1
